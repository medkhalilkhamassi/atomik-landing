        "q4": "How fast is it?",
        "a4": "Most micro-tasks are claimed within minutes and completed within 12 hours. You can parallelize dozens of tasks to build features overnight.",
        "q5": "Who owns the code?",
        "a5": "You do. 100%. Code is work-for-hire and ownership transfers upon payment release from escrow.",
        "q6": "How do developer payouts work?",
        "a6": "Payouts are instant upon verified test completion. We handle the escrow and transfer, developers get paid in USD or USDC."
